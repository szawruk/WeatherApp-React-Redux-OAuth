# WeatherApp-React-Redux-OAuth

Simple weather app done mainly with the help of React, Redux, OAuth, mongoDB Atlas and Express.js. It allows users to log in with an Google account and save favourite cities in a list. This is kind of an Fullstack project, it has backend part with own API and frontend part with the app.

The API I used to fetch the weather is AccuWeatherAPI.
